# create-program

Create a simple TypeScript program.

**This project is currently in the exploratory phase.**

I am trying to figure out how to set up some simple Node.js programs written in TypeScript. I am having ridiculous
levels of troubles doing this and getting everything right: package manager, ESM, test suite...
I'm hoping that in the end, I will have a scaffolding tool to create other apps.

## Following Node.js instructions

The Node.js documentation has a [getting started](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/nodejs-with-typescript) page
for how to set up a TypeScript project.
